Hello! I'm a 3rd-year Civil Engineering PhD student (candidate since 12/22!) at the University of Virginia's School of Engineering & Applied Sciences, and investigating remote sensing applications to address questions related to Earth's hydrologic cycle. I'm especially motivated to increase knowledge and develop practical data products for underresourced regions, where communities at greater risk of climate change impacts could benefit from the growing wealth of data. I assess the utility of remotely sensed products at the regional scale, and am interested in supporting efforts to build and maintain a more robust network of sensors in topographically complex regions. Although I am now locally based in central Virginia, my research interests are informed by past experiences and friends from around the world, ranging from rainforests of Southeastern Alaska to the semi-arid savannahs of South Africa. My thesis will focus on permafrost and seasonally frozen ground across High Mountain Asia.

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Mapping Permafrost Extent in High Mountain Asia using Remotely Sensing Data Products
- Modeling Ground Temperature Profiles in the Himalayas/HMA
- Modeling Discharge in a Himalayan Catchment
- HiRes Soil Moisture Estimates using L-band Radiometer on board UAV
- Relating Groundwater Storage Trends in Southeastern Africa (Limpopo) with Vegetation & Drought Conditions
