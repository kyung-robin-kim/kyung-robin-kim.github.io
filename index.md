Hello! I'm a 2nd-year Civil Engineering PhD student at the University of Virginia's School of Engineering & Applied Sciences, and am investigating remote sensing applications to address questions related to Earth's hydrologic cycle. I'm especially motivated to increase knowledge and develop practical data products/solutions for underresourced regions, where communities at greater risk of climate change impacts could benefit from the growing wealth of global remotely sensed observations. Although I am now locally based in central Virginia, my research interests are informed by past experiences and friends from around the world, ranging from the mountainous rainforests of Southeastern Alaska to the semi-arid plains of South Africa.

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Mapping Permafrost Extent in High Mountain Asia
- Relating Water Storage Anomalies in Southern Africa with ENSO
